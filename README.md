## **Introduction**

**Planning Stage**

I started the project thinking about what functionality it should have, first creating the wireframe. After that, I worked on the database and on the HTML and CSS codes to be able to visualize my creation and only then start adding the codes.

**Project Goals**

It was the creation of a responsive recipe blog that works on any mobile device and is more focused on Brazilian food, but that doesn't prevent anyone from adding their recipes, regardless of where they are.
The blog is interactive; you can share and comment on recipes already posted.

**Site Owner Goals**

* Provide an interactive and easy-to-use website.
* Connecting people who enjoy good food.

**User Goals**

* Ability to share their own favorite recipes.
* Create user account to interact.

**User Stories**

* Site pagination - As a Site User I can view a paginated list of posts so that easily select a post to view

* Approve comments - As a Site Admin I can approve or disapprove comments so that I can filter out objectionable comments

* Create Drafts - As a Site Admin I can create draft posts so that I can finish writing the content later

* Manage Posts - As a Site Admin I can create, read, update and delete posts so that I can manage my blog content

* Like / Unlike - As a Site User I can like or unlike a post so that I can interact with the content

* Comment on a post - As a Site User I can leave comments on a post so that I can be involved in the conversation

* Account Registration - As a Site User I can register an account so that I can comment and like

* View comments - As a Site User / Admin I can view comments on an individual post so that I can read the conversation

* View likes - As a Site User / Admin I can view the number of likes on each post so that I can see which is the most popular or viral

* Open a post - As a Site User I can click on a post so that I can read the full text

* View post list - As a Site User I can view a list of posts so that I can select one to read

**Design Goals**

* A site that works on all devices. 
* Easy to understand and use.
* Clean and sophisticated design.

**Design Choices**

* Font

The font used was comforta due to its modern style and easy readability.

* Color Scheme

On the site, I chose to use softer colours so that the attention wouldn't diverted from the recipes that are the focus, also used a darker green in the main bars so that the person can quickly view the registration and social networks both at the top of the page and at the footer.

- White: #F9F9F9 - Background
- Dark green: #95b5ac - top bar with sign up / login and social footer bar
- light gray - #ced4da - Subscribe and contact bar


* Logo Lulu's Kitchen

I used Photoshop to create my logo and decided on a text and a food image on the left.

**Wireframes**

I used Balsamic wireframe to define the site's basic structure and visualize the project and plan.

## **Features**

### Design Features

* Header

The header consists of a sign-up and login bar in the upper left and social media in the upper right corner. The logo is also centred and stands out due to its size. The navigation menu is simple, easy to use, centralized, and can be seen on all pages.
In responsive mode, the navigation turns into a hamburger button, and the site's logo goes to the top left corner.

* Home Page

When visiting the site, you are already received with the recipes registered with the user registration button and in the menu below the button that will take you to the page to add new recipes.

* Footer

The footer is simple in muted colour tones, and consists of a subscribe bar, copyright information, and social media links.
